HTML Structure
Every HTML document follows a basic structure:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <!-- Metadata, stylesheets, scripts, etc. -->
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Content of the webpage -->
</body>
</html>

<!DOCTYPE html>: This declaration at the beginning specifies the HTML version as HTML5.
<html>: The root element that encloses the entire HTML document.
<head>: The section that contains meta-information about the document, such as the page title, character encoding, linked stylesheets, and scripts.
<body>: The section that holds the visible content of the webpage.
